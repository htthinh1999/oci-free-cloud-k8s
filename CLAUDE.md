# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

Personal infrastructure-as-code for a Kubernetes cluster (OKE) running on Oracle Cloud's
Always Free tier (2 oCPU / 12GB, ARM `VM.Standard.A1.Flex` nodes — **arm64 only, no x86**).
There is no application source code here — this is Terraform + FluxCD GitOps config.
It's a personal/playground setup, loosely documented and opinionated; changes should fit the
existing patterns rather than introduce new tooling or abstractions.

## Repository layout

* `terraform/infra/` — provisions everything up to a working k8s API endpoint (VCN, subnets,
  security lists, the OKE cluster and node pool). Must be applied first.
* `terraform/config/` — k8s-level config that depends on a live API server (via `modules/`:
  `external-secrets`, `fluxcd`, `grafana`, `ingress`). Applied after `infra`.
* `gitops/core/` — one directory per component, reconciled by FluxCD (not `terraform apply`).
  Editing files under `gitops/` changes cluster state only after Flux reconciles from git —
  there's no local "build" step to run.
* `nuc/` — plain Kubernetes manifests for a **separate cluster**: a home NUC running microk8s,
  unrelated to the OKE cluster above and not touched by this repo's Flux instance at all (it only
  watches `gitops/core`). Apply by hand: `kubectl --context=nuc-tailscale apply -f nuc/<name>/`.
  Kept here purely for version history/reproducibility, not for reconciliation.

These two Terraform roots and the gitops tree are intentionally decoupled (separate state files,
separate providers) to keep runs fast and avoid provider coupling. Never merge them.

## GitOps component structure (`gitops/core/<name>/`)

Every component follows the same file convention — when adding a new one, copy this shape:

* `namespace.yaml` — namespace definition
* `flux.yaml` — the `HelmRepository`/`GitRepository` + `HelmRelease`, OR (at the `gitops/core/`
  level) the `Kustomization` that points Flux at this component's path
* `helm.yaml` — `HelmRepository` + `HelmRelease` (chart, version, values)
* `secret.yaml` — `ExternalSecret` pulling from the OCI Vault via the `oracle-vault`
  `ClusterSecretStore` (see `gitops/core/external-secrets/`)
* `httproute.yaml` — Gateway API `HTTPRoute` (envoy-gateway), when the component is exposed
* `securitypolicy.yaml` — OIDC/auth protection on the `HTTPRoute` via envoy-gateway
  `SecurityPolicy`, when applicable
* `kustomization.yaml` — lists the above as `resources`; the top-level
  `gitops/core/kustomization.yaml` lists every component's `flux.yaml`

New components must be registered in `gitops/core/kustomization.yaml` and typically declare
`dependsOn: [external-secrets]` in their `Kustomization` (in `flux.yaml`) since most components
pull secrets from the vault.

Ingress uses **Gateway API** (envoy-gateway), not `nginx-ingress` — use `HTTPRoute`, not
`Ingress` resources, for anything new.

## Commands

```bash
# format all yaml (gitops manifests) - excludes flux-system and grafana dashboards, see .yamlfmt
yamlfmt

# run all pre-commit hooks (yamlfmt, case/merge-conflict checks, private-key detection, etc.)
pre-commit run --all-files

# terraform — run from terraform/infra/ or terraform/config/ (never the repo root)
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

There are no application tests. Linting is `pre-commit` for repo conventions.

### Terraform specifics

* State is stored remotely using Terraform's native `oci` backend (requires Terraform **>= 1.12**);
  see `_terraform.tf` in each of `infra/` and `config/` for the bucket/namespace/key.
* `terraform/config` needs a private (untracked) `*.tfvars` with secrets like `compartment_id`,
  a GitHub fine-grained PAT, etc. Some variables are only available from `terraform/infra` output
  or the OCI web console.
* First-time `terraform apply` in `config/` is expected to fail creating the `ClusterSecretStore`
  (it depends on `external-secrets` being deployed by Flux first) — just re-apply afterward.
* Kubernetes cluster access after `infra` apply comes from the generated `.kube.config` file in
  `terraform/infra/`; see the Teleport section of `README.md` for the regulated-access path.

## Conventions

* YAML formatting is enforced by `yamlfmt` (150 char max line length, line breaks retained) — run
  it (or `pre-commit run --all-files`) before committing gitops changes.
* Renovate manages dependency updates for `terraform` and Flux `HelmRelease`/`HelmRepository`
  files matching `helm.yaml`; grouped into a single weekly PR (Monday before 3am, Europe/Berlin).
  Docker image updates are disabled.
* Secrets are never committed in plaintext — they're pulled from the OCI Vault via
  `ExternalSecret`/`ClusterSecretStore` (`secret.yaml` in each component), or passed through
  Terraform variables backed by untracked `*.tfvars` files.

## Before pushing / finishing a session

Validate what you changed before pushing: `pre-commit run --all-files` (or `yamlfmt`),
`kubectl kustomize <dir>` for touched `gitops/` components, and `terraform validate` in
whichever Terraform root you edited.
